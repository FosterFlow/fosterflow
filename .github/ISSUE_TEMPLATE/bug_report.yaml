        # Bug Report

        ## Important Notes

        - **Before submitting a bug report**: Please check the [Issues](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions) sections to see if a similar issue has already been reported. If unsure, start a discussion first, as this helps us efficiently focus on improving the project.

        - **Respectful collaboration**: Open WebUI is a volunteer-driven project with a single maintainer and contributors who also have full-time jobs. Please be constructive and respectful in your communication.

        - **Contributing**: If you encounter an issue, consider submitting a pull request or forking the project. We prioritize preventing contributor burnout to maintain Open WebUI's quality.

        - **Bug Reproducibility**: If a bug cannot be reproduced using a `:main` or `:dev` Docker setup or with `pip install` on Python 3.11, community assistance may be required. In such cases, we will move it to the "[Issues](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/categories/issues)" Discussions section. Your help is appreciated!
