Our project is a startup that leverages the power of the GPT4 and LLM/ML models. The main objective is to create a
unified application that combines the comprehensive functionality offered ML models with our UI mechanics.
By harnessing the capabilities of the GPT like models, we aim to provide users with a seamless and intelligent
conversational experience within a single application.

## Overview

For the frontend, we have selected React.js, while for the backend, we have decided to use Django Rest Framework. The
communication between the frontend and backend is facilitated through APIs. We have made significant progress in the
implementation phase, completing the following tasks:

1. **Application UI Design**: We have designed and developed the user interface of the application, ensuring an
   intuitive and visually appealing experience for our users.
2. **User Authentication with JWT**: The application features secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT),
   providing a seamless and reliable authentication mechanism.
3. **Email Confirmation Functionality**: We have implemented email confirmation functionality, ensuring that user
   accounts are verified through a confirmation link sent to their registered email addresses.
4. **Integration with the Language Model**: We have successfully integrated the Chat-GPT language model into the
   application, enabling advanced natural language processing capabilities and intelligent conversations.
5. **Swagger Documentation**: To ensure clarity and facilitate API usage, we have provided documentation using Swagger,
   outlining the available endpoints, request/response structures, and parameters.

## Todo

There are the upcoming tasks and features on our todo list that we plan to implement:

* **Single sign-on**: Enable users to authenticate and log in to the application using their social media accounts such
  as Facebook, Twitter, or Google. This will provide a convenient and streamlined login experience for our users.
* **Real-time response generation**: Implement a continuous stream of generated responses within the application. This
  will enhance the conversational experience by allowing users to receive dynamic and immediate responses as they
  interact with the system.
* **Access to different types of LLM/ML models**: Allow users to smoothly switch to the best model for solving an exact
  task using model name @model_name like we do with real users into chats.
